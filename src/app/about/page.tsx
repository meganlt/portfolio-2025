        <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">About Me</h2>
        <p className="text-xl mt-4">I'm a full-stack software engineer with a background in user experience and front-end devlopment, with a passion for building clean, thoughtful digital experiences.</p> 
        <p className="text-xl mt-4">With experience across the stack, from JavaScript and React to Express and PostgreSQL, I approach each development project as a technical craft and creative process.</p>
        <p className="text-xl mt-4">Outside of tech, I’m a hands-on general creative person. I love making things, whether it’s through art, crafting, or tending to my ever-growing plant collection (I currently work at greenhouse part-time). I like to bring that same curiosity and care into my professional work, blending problem-solving with design thinking to build tools that are both functional, enjoyable to use, and fun to look at.</p>
