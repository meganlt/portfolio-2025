        <div className="mt-4 p-8 rounded-2xl shadow-md bg-white hover:shadow-lg transition">
          <p className="text-xl">I'm a full-stack developer with a background in user experience and front-end devlopment, with a passion for building clean, intentional products.</p> 
          <p className="text-xl mt-4">With experience across the stack, from React, Javascript, and CSS to Express and PostgreSQL, I approach each development project as a technical craft and creative process.</p>
          <p className="text-xl mt-4">Outside of tech, I’m a hands-on general artistic person. I love making things, whether it’s through art, crafting, or tending to my ever-growing plant collection (I currently work at greenhouse part-time). I like to bring that same curiosity and care into my professional work, blending problem-solving with design thinking to build tools that are both functional, enjoyable to use, and fun to look at.</p>
          <p className="text-xl mt-4">In addition to development, I also create custom illustrations for clients and friends. If you'd like to view some of my illustration work, check out my separate <a href="https://megantegeder.myportfolio.com/" target="_blank">illustration portfolio</a>, or my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/megantegeder/">instagram</a> for my most recent work.</p>
